# Time Series: Set of Observations Taken Sequentially over Time

## Types of time series

   - Regular time series: observations coming in at regular intervals of time
   - Irregular time series: do not have observations at a regular interval of time
    
## Main Areas of Application

   - Time series forecasting: predicting the future values of a time series, when past values are given
   - Time series classification: predict an action based on past values
   - Interpretation and causality: understand the interrelationships among several related time series
    
## Data-Generating Process (DGP)

   - Generating synthetic time series: generate time series using a set of fundamental building blocks
        - White noise: an extreme case of a stochastic process, a sequence of random numbers with zero mean and constant standard deviation
        - Red noise: a sequence of random numbers with zero mean and constant variance but is serially correlated in time
        - Cyclical or seasonal signals: 
        - Autoregressive signals
        - Mix and match
   - Stationary and non-stationary time series
        - Change in mean over time
        - Change in variance over time
