## Time Series Data
A time series is a sequential set of observations taken over time, such as tracking monthly chocolate consumption or monthly weight recordings. Analyzing relationships between different time series, like stock prices or heart rate readings, is explored here. 

Time series data can be categorized into two types: 
  - Regular time series: characterized by observations occurring at consistent time intervals (e.g., hourly or monthly)
  - Irregular time series: where observations are not obtained at uniform intervals

`Irregular time series are slightly more advanced and require specialized techniques to handle them.`

**Time series analysis finds application in three key areas:** 
  - Time series forecasting: predicting future values based on past data (e.g., forecasting temperature)
  - Time series classification: determining actions based on past values (e.g., classifying EEG or EKG results as normal or abnormal)
  - Interpretation and causality: understanding patterns, relationships, and deriving causal inferences from historical time series data

**Data-Generating Process (DGP) in Time Series:** <be>
A mechanism influenced by various factors. While an ideal forecast requires a perfect understanding of reality, incomplete knowledge leads to mathematical approximations, represented by a model. The model serves as an imitation, capturing essential aspects of the DGP for accurate predictions or other analytical outputs.
